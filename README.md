Enterprise VLAN Design – 
🔹 Project Description

Enterprise VLAN Design demonstrates the implementation of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) segmentation in a multi-department office environment using a Cisco 2960 switch in Cisco Packet Tracer.

The network is logically divided into three departments — HR, IT, and Finance — to enhance security, control broadcast traffic, and improve network management.

🔹 Network Design
Department	VLAN Name	VLAN ID	Ports Assigned	No. of PCs
HR	VLAN A	5	Fa0/1 – Fa0/5	2 PCs
IT	VLAN B	10	Fa0/6 – Fa0/10	5 PCs
Finance	VLAN C	15	Fa0/11 – Fa0/15	3 PCs
🔹 Configuration Summary

Created VLANs on Cisco 2960 Switch:

VLAN 5 → HR Department

VLAN 10 → IT Department

VLAN 15 → Finance Department

Assigned VLAN Names:

VLAN 5 → A

VLAN 10 → B

VLAN 15 → C

Ports were configured and mapped to their respective VLANs to ensure proper departmental segmentation.

🔹 Objective

Implement enterprise-level network segmentation

Improve security between departments

Reduce broadcast domains

Gain hands-on VLAN configuration experience

🔹 Tools Used

Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco 2960 Switch
